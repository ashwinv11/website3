    series from Latin America to iOS, Android, and the web.

    The service offers free (ad supported) or paid subscription plans to view HD
    on-demand Spanish content. I helped add new weekly, biweekly, quarterly, and
    biannual subscription plans to their iOS and Android apps. I also added
    in-app review popup that helped increase the number of reviews on the app
    store.

    Since this was a legacy codebase written with
    <a href="https://tabris.com">Tabris.js</a>, we had a high
    number of crashes due to older dependencies â€“ particularly on Android. By
    gradually and carefully upgrading these dependencies to more stable releases,
    we were able to ship a more bug free Android experience and saw a reduced
    number of crashes in the Google Play store.
